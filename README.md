Machine Learning Concepts With Code
===================================

Overview
--------
- Hands-on explanations of core machine learning ideas with fully worked Python examples.
- Focus on clarity: small, concrete numbers, step-by-step calculations, and inline comments.
- Mix of math intuition and executable code so you can see how equations translate into operations.

What You Will Find
------------------
- Intuitive walkthroughs of algorithms (e.g., attention) with tiny, traceable datasets.
- Explanations of the math behind each step: shapes, dot products, softmax, normalization.
- Jupyter notebooks that combine narrative, formulas, and runnable cells.

Current Contents
----------------
- [Attention/attention.ipynb](Attention/attention.ipynb): from raw queries/keys/values to attention scores, weights, and outputs, with commented calculations and visual intuition.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install Python 3.10+ and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sssstf0rest/Machine-Learning-Concepts-With-Code.git`
3. Enter the folder: `cd Machine-Learning-Concepts-With-Code`
4. Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
5. Open a notebook (e.g., `Attention/attention.ipynb`) and run cells top to bottom.

How to Read the Notebooks
-------------------------
- Follow the markdown narrative first to understand the goal of each section.
- Run each code cell to verify intermediate values match the explained math.
- Pay attention to comments that map variables to symbols in the equations.
- Tweak numbers to see how outputs change—this reinforces the mechanics.

Project Goals
-------------
- Keep examples minimal so every number is easy to track by hand.
- Bridge math notation and code implementation for each concept.
- Grow coverage of foundational techniques before jumping into full models.

Planned Additions
-----------------
- Linear and logistic regression with gradient walkthroughs.
- Naive Bayes with count-based and smoothing intuition.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) with stepwise projection math.
- Basic feedforward network backprop with small tensors.

Contributing
------------
- Keep datasets tiny and values inspectable.
- Prefer explicit intermediate variables over clever one-liners.
- Add comments when code corresponds directly to an equation step.
